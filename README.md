The traditional way of maintaining registers and manuals for storing quantities of
a shopâ€™s products is a laborious task and requires a lot of manual intervention. It
becomes a tiresome job especially when the business is vast and spread across
different departments and stores. Our software comes handy to solve this problem.
The Smart Inventory Management System is an online software application which fulfills
the requirement of a typical Stock Analysis in various godowns. It provides the interface to users
in a graphical way to manage the daily transactions as well as historical data.It also provides
the management reports like monthly inwards, monthly deliveries and monthly returns.The aim
of this application is to reduce the manual effort needed to manage transactions and historical
data used in departments of various stores in a business.
This application maintains the centralized database so that any changes done at a
location are reflected immediately. Also this application provides an interface to users to view
the details like the daily Stock Statements of all stores.
The software uses Machine Learning to predict the future sales and thus notify the
owners about upcoming shortages in their inventories and thus thereby help them maximize
their profit and stay ahead of their counterparts in the competitive market.
